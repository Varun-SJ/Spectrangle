### Starting application
For the Game to be tested, the Game class contains a main method that can be run by the compiler. In this loop a Human and a ComputerPlayer are created to play a game together.

For running the Server and Client applications, also these can be run as they contain a main method. The console will be used as a TUI for starting up these classes in order to play a game. Follow the instructions given, this should be pretty clear once it runs.
